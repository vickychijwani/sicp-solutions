SICP Solutions
==============

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd edition](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp). The Scheme implementation used is MIT/GNU Scheme.

NOTE
----
 - Files prefixed with a tilde (~) denote incomplete / incorrect solutions.
 - Single digit exercise numbers are padded (i.e., 1.7 becomes 1.07) so that the files containing solutions are sorted correctly in the repository.
